# Whisper_helper
This is a simple script to help non-programmers to simplify their workflow through audio file transcription.

Note: in order to use the script you need to install 
- ```ffmpeg```
- ```whisper```

  All instructions can be found on the Whisper GitHub page above. 

- ```Python``` (to install go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and follow instructions)

Currently the prompts / prints are in French, but can be quickly translated if I get requests in that sense. 

Hope this helps, 

If you have any comment or feedback regarding the script, please feel free to get in touch !
