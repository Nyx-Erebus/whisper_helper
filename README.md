# Whisper_helper
This is a simple script to help non-programmers to simplify their workflow through audio file transcription.

Note you need to install ```ffmpeg```, and obviously Python & Whisper. All instructions can be found on the Whisper GitHub page above. 

Currently the prompts / prints are in French, but can be quickly translated if I get requests in that sense. 

Hope this helps, 

If you have any comment or feedback regarding the script, please feel free to get in touch !
